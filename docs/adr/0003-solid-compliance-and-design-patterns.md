# 0003. SOLID Compliance And Established Design Patterns

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This package is built around explicit responsibilities, replaceable collaborators, and contract-driven extension
points. As the number of classes, extension surfaces, and runtime decisions grows, the cost of ad hoc design also
grows.

Without a shared design standard, several problems appear quickly:

- responsibilities become mixed across controllers, resolvers, builders, validators, and runtime adapters
- extension work starts to require modifications in existing classes instead of adding new implementations
- abstractions stop matching the concrete behavior they are supposed to hide
- interfaces become too broad and force consumers to depend on methods they do not need
- concrete framework or library details leak into parts of the code that should stay decoupled
- teams begin to solve the same recurring design problems with one-off custom structures instead of recognizable
  patterns

The project already uses object-oriented extension points and recurring collaboration shapes that naturally align with
well-known design principles and patterns. Examples already present in the codebase include factory-style construction,
strategy-like interchangeable components, adapter-style boundaries, and builder/configurator responsibilities.

## Decision

All new code and all materially touched refactors must be designed to comply with SOLID principles.

The normative expectations are:

- **Single Responsibility Principle** — each class or module must have one clear reason to change; orchestration,
  validation, storage resolution, runtime execution, and authorization concerns must stay separated
- **Open/Closed Principle** — new behavior should preferably be introduced by adding implementations, collaborators,
  or composition points instead of modifying stable existing code
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** — implementations behind contracts must remain behaviorally substitutable for the
  abstractions they implement
- **Interface Segregation Principle** — interfaces must stay focused and client-specific rather than turning into wide
  "do everything" contracts
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** — high-level policy and orchestration code must depend on abstractions, not
  concrete infrastructure details

In addition, when a recurring design problem clearly matches a known design pattern, the implementation must prefer an
established pattern over an ad hoc custom structure.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Factory / Factory Method / Abstract Factory** — for object creation that would otherwise couple client code to
  concrete classes
- **Strategy** — for interchangeable runtime behavior such as resolution, validation, authorization, or
  backend-specific logic
- **Builder** — for stepwise construction of complex objects or trees
- **Adapter** — for isolating framework or library boundaries behind package-level contracts
- **Facade** — for presenting a smaller, intention-revealing interface to a more complex subsystem
- **Decorator** — for extending behavior compositionally without modifying the wrapped implementation

The preference is for recognized, widely understood patterns with established names and expectations. Custom one-off
structures are not preferred when a standard pattern already fits the same problem.

At the same time, patterns must not be introduced ceremonially:

- a pattern is required when it genuinely clarifies a recurring design problem
- a simpler direct implementation is still valid when no real pattern-level problem exists
- unnecessary abstraction layers must not be introduced just to claim pattern usage

## Consequences

Advantages:

- design discussions gain a shared vocabulary
- responsibilities stay clearer and more stable over time
- extension points become easier to add without destabilizing existing code
- framework and vendor details remain better contained at the edges
- new contributors can recognize intent from familiar principles and pattern shapes
- refactoring decisions become easier to justify and review

Disadvantages:

- design work becomes more opinionated and review standards become stricter
- some solutions may require more classes or interfaces than a minimal ad hoc implementation
- incorrect or over-eager pattern application can increase complexity if the team is not disciplined

Rejected alternatives:

- **Allow each feature to choose its own design style** — rejected because it leads to inconsistency, weaker
  maintainability, and avoidable architectural drift.
- **Require only SOLID but stay neutral on patterns** — rejected because recurring problems benefit from a shared,
  conventional set of solutions and terminology.
- **Require a design pattern for every non-trivial class** — rejected because it encourages ceremony and
  over-engineering instead of clarity.
